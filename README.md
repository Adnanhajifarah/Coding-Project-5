A general purpose system programming language.

Lab Assignment 6

1. Characters for the ASCII Codes
Write a program that uses a loop to display the characters for the ASCII
codes 33 through 127. Display 16 characters on each line.

2. Math Tutor
Write a program that asks the user to select addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, or quit. The user should then enter two numbers.
First display the two numbers without the answer, then display the answer
once the user presses enter. Once completed, the program should show
the menu again.

3. Celsius to Fahrenheit
Modify the previous Celsius to Fahrenheit so that it uses a loop to display
a table of the Celsius temperatures (0-20), and the Fahrenheit equivalents.
(PROBLEMS 4 AND 5 ARE DOWN BELOW)

4. Random Number Guessing Game
Write a program that generates a random number between 1-100 and asks
the user to guess what the number is. If the user’s guess is higher than the
random number, the program should display “Too high, try again.” If the
user’s guess is lower than the random number, the program should display
“Too low, try again.” The program should loop until the user correctly
guesses the random number and output the amount of attempts that the
user took to guess.

5. Square Display
Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer no greater than 15.
The program should then display a square on the screen using the
character ‘X’. The number entered by the user will be the length of each
size of the square. For Example if the user enters 5:
XXXXX
XXXXX
XXXXX
XXXXX
XXXXX

6. Using Files - Numeric Processing
If you look in your program directory you will find a file named Random.txt in the Chapter 05
folder. This file contains a long list of random numbers. Write a program that opens the file,
reads all the numbers from the file, and calculates the following:

a. The number of numbers in the file
b. The sum of all the numbers in the file (a running total)
c. The average of all the numbers in the file.

The program should then display the number of numbers found in the file, the sum of the
numbers, and the average of the numbers.
